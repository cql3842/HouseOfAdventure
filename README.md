# HouseOfAdventure

	Life is about adventures. What’s the point in limiting yourself to enjoying so few? The base idea behind this project is not mine, in fact it’s from 1967! Alison Knowles and James Tenney worked on. I took my own creative spin on this, instead flavoring it towards the idea of storytelling -- specifically adventure.

	In each stanza, a random word will become hyperlinked. Clicking on it allows you to continue the story, until you choose to stop. Hopefully the House of Adventures will bring you along on a journey.
